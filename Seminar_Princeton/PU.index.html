Weighted enumeration of consecutive 123-avoiding permutations
and the Hurwitz zeta function
</b>
<br>
A permutation &pi; =(&pi;<sub>1</sub>,...,&pi;<sub>n</sub>) 
is consecutive 123-avoiding if
there is no index i such that 
&pi;<sub>i</sub> < &pi;<sub>i+1</sub> < &pi;<sub>i+2</sub>.
Similarly, a permutation &pi; is cyclically consecutive 123-avoiding if
the indices are viewed modulo n. We consider a weighted enumeration
problem of consecutive 123-avoiding permutations where we able to to
determine an asymptotic expansion of the weighted enumeration.  For
the cyclically weighted enumeration we are able to determine an exact
expression in terms of the Hurwitz zeta function. This yields 
an explicit
combinatorial expression for the higher derivatives of the cotangent
function.

Kronecker coefficients -- combinatorics, complexity and beyond.
</b>
<br>
The Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ are defined as the multiplicity of an irreducible representation $S_\lambda$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ in the tensor product of two other irreducibles,  $S_\mu \otimes S_\nu$. Finding a positive combinatorial formula for these nonnegative integers or even criteria for their positivity   has been a 75+ year old problem in representation theory and algebraic combinatorics. Recently, the Kronecker coefficients appeared as central objects in the field of Geometric Complexity Theory and more questions about their computational complexity emerged. 
<p>
In this talk we will discuss a few problems of different characters involving these coefficients -- the Saxl conjecture on the tensor square $S_\delta \otimes S_\delta$ where $\delta$ is the staircase partition, the combinatorial side with the new proof of Sylvester's theorem on the unimodality of the q-binomial coefficients as polynomials in q giving effective bounds on both, and some complexity results.

<b>
Counting genus one partitions and permutations
</b>
<br>
The study of counting rooted maps was initiated by Tutte, who was
motivated by the four color conjecture, and the study of hypermaps 
grew out of this initiative. Hypermaps are pairs of
permutations that can be topologically represented by labeled maps, the
genus of the underlying surface may be expressed purely algebraically in
terms of these permutations. Looking at the special case of
rooted hypermonopoles leads to the definition of the genus of a
permutation.  
 
<p>
In this talk we prove a conjecture of Martha Yip
stating that counting genus one partitions by the number of their
elements and parts yields, up to a shift of indices, the same array of
numbers as counting genus one rooted hypermonopoles. Our proof involves
representing each genus one permutation by a four-colored noncrossing
partition. This representation may be selected in a unique way for
permutations containing no trivial cycles. The conclusion follows from a
general generating function formula that holds for any class of
permutations that is closed under the removal and reinsertion of trivial
cycles. Our method also provides another way to count rooted
hypermonopoles of genus one, and puts the spotlight on a class of genus
one permutations that is invariant under an obvious extension of the
Kreweras duality map to genus one permutations.

Voronoi neighbors of D<sub>n</sub> lattices
</b>
<br>
Voronoi defined a tiling of the space of positive definite quadratic
forms on R<sup>n</sup>.  
Each tile is determined by a perfect lattice.  Examples
of perfect lattices include the root lattices A<sub>n</sub> 
and D<sub>n</sub>.  We will
focus on the tiles that are neighbors of a D<sub>n</sub> tile.  These are
determined by some simple combinatorics, but there are exponentially
many different D<sub>n</sub> neighbors, and only a few families of them have
been understood for all n.  I will report on two recent results, one
due to myself, and one joint work with Noam Elkies.

Multiply tiling Euclidean space by translations 
of a convex object
</b>
<br>

We study the problem of covering Euclidean space R<sup>d</sup> by possibly
overlapping translates of a convex body P such that almost every
point is covered exactly k times for a fixed integer k.  Such a
covering of Euclidean space by translations of P is called a k-tiling.
Classical tilings by translations (which are 1-tilings in this
context) began with the work of the famous crystallographer Fedorov
and with the work of Minkowski, who founded the Geometry of Numbers.
Some 50 years later Venkov and McMullen gave a complete
characterization of all convex objects that 1-tile Euclidean space.

<p>

Today we know that k-tilings can be tackled by methods from Fourier
analysis, though some of their aspects can also be studied using purely
combinatorial means.  For many of our results there is both a
combinatorial proof and a Harmonic analysis proof.  For k  larger than 1
the collection of convex objects that k-tile is much wider than the
collection of objects that 1-tile. So it's a more diverse subject with
plenty (infinite families) of examples in R<sup>2</sup> as well.   There is currently
no complete knowledge of the polytopes that k-tile in dimension 3 or
larger, and even in dimension 2 it is still challenging.  We will cover
both ``ancient'' as well as very recent results concerning 1-tilings and
other k-tilings.  This is based on some joint work with Nick Gravin, 
Dmitry Shiryaev, and Mihalis Kolountzakis.

Smith normal form and combinatorics
</b>
<br>
If A is an m x n matrix over a PID R 
(and sometimes more general rings), 
then there exists an m x m matrix P and an 
n x n matrix Q, both invertible over R, 
such that PAQ is a matrix that vanishes off the main diagonal, 
and whose main diagonal elements 
e<sub>1</sub>,
e<sub>2</sub>,
&hellip; ,
e<sub>m</sub> satisfy 
e<sub>i</sub> | e<sub>i+1</sub> in 
R. The matrix PAQ is called a 
<em>Smith normal form</em>
 (SNF) of A. 
The SNF is unique up to multiplication of the 
e<sub>i</sub>'s by units in R. 
We will discuss some aspects of SNF related to combinatorics. 
In particular, we will give examples of SNF 
for some combinatorially interesting matrices. We also discuss 
a theory of SNF 
for random matrices over the integers recently developed by Yinghui Wang.

Another (q,t) world
</b>
<br>
A well studied (q,t)-analogue of symmetric functions are the Macdonald
polynomials. In this talk I will survey another (q,t)-analogue, where
q is a prime power from a finite field and t is an
indeterminate. Analogues of facts about the symmetric group S<sub>n</sub> are
given for GL<sub>n</sub>(F<sub>q</sub>), including

<p>

(1) counting factorizations of certain elements into reflections,
(2) combinatorial properties of appropriate (q,t)-binomial coefficients,
(3) Hilbert series for invariants on polynomial rings.

 <p>

Some new conjectured explicit Hilbert series of rings of invariants
over finite fields are given. This is joint work with Joel Lewis and
Vic Reiner.

q-Combinatorics:  A new view
</b>
<p>
The idea of q-analogues can be traced back to Euler in the 1700's who
was studying q-series, especially specializations of theta functions.
Recall a q-analogue is a method to enumerate a set of objects by
keeping track of its mathematical structure.  For example, a
combinatorial interpretation of the q-analogue of the Gaussian
polynomial due to MacMahon in 1916 is given by summing over all 0-1
bit strings consisting of n-k zeroes and k ones the statistic q to the
inversion number.  Setting q=1 returns to the familiar binomial
coefficient.
<p>
In this talk we show the classical q-Stirling numbers of the second
kind can be expressed more compactly as a pair of statistics on a
subset of restricted growth words. The resulting expressions are
polynomials in q and 1 + q.  We extend this enumerative result via a
decomposition of a new poset whose rank generating function is the
q-Stirling number S<sub>q</sub>[n,k] which we call the Stirling poset of the
second kind.  This poset supports an algebraic complex and a basis for
integer homology is determined.  This is another instance of Hersh,
Shareshian and Stanton's homological version of the Stembridge q = -1
phenomenon.  A parallel enumerative, poset theoretic and homological
study for the q-Stirling numbers of the first kind is done beginning
with de M&eacute;dicis and Leroux's rook placement formulation.
Time permitting, we will indicate a bijective argument 
&agrave; la Viennot
showing the (q,t)-Stirling numbers of the first and second kind are
orthogonal.

This is joint work with Margaret Readdy.
