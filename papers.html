The Chung-Feller theorem assserts the number of lattice paths 
from the origin to (2n,0) with northeast and southeast steps having 2r steps
above the x-axis is independent of r, and is given by the Catalan number C<sub>n</sub>.
Generalizations are due to Raney and Huq.
We study two classes of permutations related to the proof of 
Spitzer's lemma and Huq's generalization of the Chung-Feller theorem.
This leads to a generalization of Flajolet's results from
continued fractions to continuants,
as well as a restricted variant of the Foata-Strehl group action.

This paper gives a dissection proof of the n-dimensional
pizza theorem that the authors prove
 in a previous article.
The alternating sum identity is lifted to an abstract
dissection group where the volume of the regions
is replaced by any affine isometry invariant valuation.
This includes all cases of the intrinsic volumes.
The key ingredient is to relate the alternating sums of the values of certain valuations over the chambers of a Coxeter arrangement to
similar alternating sums of simpler subarrangements called 2-structures.

We introduce and prove the
n-dimensional Pizza Theorem:
For H a hyperplane arrangement in n-dimensional Euclidean space
containing K a measurable set of finite volume,
the pizza quantity of K is the alternating sum
of the volumes of the regions obtained
by intersecting K with the arrangement H.
We prove that if H is a Coxeter arrangement different
from A<sub>1</sub><sup>n</sup>
such that the group of isometries W generated by the reflections
in the hyperplanes of H contains the map -id, and
if K is a translate of a
convex body that is stable under W and contains the origin, then the
pizza quantity of K is equal to zero.
Our main tool is an induction
formula for the pizza quantity involving a subarrangement of the
restricted arrangement on hyperplanes of H that we call the
<em>even
  restricted arrangement</em>.
More generally, we prove that for a class of
arrangements that we call <em> even</em>
(this includes the aforementioned Coxeter arrangements)
and for a <em> sufficiently symmetric </em> set K,
the pizza quantity of K+a is
polynomial in a for a small enough, for example if K is convex and
the origin is in K+a. We
obtain stronger results in the case of balls, more generally, convex
bodies bounded by quadratic hypersurfaces. For example, we prove that
the pizza quantity of the ball centered at
a having radius R &geq; |a| vanishes
for a Coxeter arrangement H with |H| - n an even positive integer. We also
prove the Pizza Theorem for the surface volume: When H is a Coxeter
arrangement and |H| - n  is a nonnegative even integer, for
an n-dimensional
ball the alternating sum of the (n-1)-dimensional surface volumes of
the regions is equal to zero.

  A generalization of combinatorial identities

<em> Journal of Combinatorial Algebra, </em>
<b> 6</b> (2022), no. 1, 109--183,
with R. Ehrenborg and S. Morel. 
<br>

This article is concerned
with  the constants appearing in Harish-Chandra's character
formula for stable discrete series of real reductive groups.
In Harish-Chandra' work the only information we have about
these constants is that they are uniquely determined by an inductive
property. Later Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson and Herb gave different
formulas for these constants.
We generalize these formulas to the case of
arbitrary finite Coxeter groups (in this setting, discrete series no
longer make sense), and give a direct proof that the two formulas
agree. We actually prove a slightly more general identity that also
implies the combinatorial identity underlying the discrete series
character identities of Morel (2011).
We also introduce a
signed convolution of valuations on polyhedral cones in Euclidean
space and show that the resulting function is a valuation. This gives
a theoretical framework for the valuation appearing in
Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson (1997).
In Appendix B we extend the notion of 2-structures (due to Herb)
to pseudo-root systems.

<br>
The Legendre polytope, also known as the type A full root polytope,
is the convex hull of all pairwise differences
of the standard basis vectors.
We completely classify all flag triangulations of
this polytope that are uniform in the sense that the edges may be
described as a function of the relative order of the indices of the
four basis vectors involved. These triangulations fall naturally into
three classes: the lex class, the revlex class and the Simion
class. We also determine that the refined face counts of these
triangulations only depend on the class of the triangulations. The
refined face generating functions are expressed in terms of the
Catalan and Delannoy generating functions and the modified Bessel
function of the first kind.

<br>
We generalize chain enumeration in graded posets by relaxing
the graded, poset and Eulerian requirements.
The resulting balanced digraphs,
which include the classical Eulerian posets having an R-labeling,
imply the existence of the
(non-homogeneous) cd-index.
An analogue of Alexander duality for balanced digraphs holds.
For Bruhat graphs of Coxeter groups, an important family of balanced graphs,
our theory gives elementary proofs of the existence of the complete cd-index
and its properties.
The rising and falling quasisymmetric functions of a labeled acyclic
digraph are introduced and shown to be Hopf algebra homomorpisms
mapping balanced digraphs to the Stembridge peak algebra.

We present a bijection between balanced Delannoy paths of length 2n
and the faces of the n-dimensional Simion type B associahedron.  This
polytope is also known as the Bott-Taubes polytope and the
cyclohedron.  This bijection takes a path with k up steps (and k down
steps) to a (k-1)-dimensional face of Simion's type B
associahedron.  We give two presentations of this bijection, one
recursive and one non-recursive.

<br>
In Morel's computation of the intersection cohomology of
Shimura varieties, or of the L<sup>2</sup> co-homology
of equal rank locally symmetric spaces,
combinatorial identities involving averaged discrete series characters of real reductive groups play a large technical role.
These identities can become very complicated
and are not always well-understood.
We propose a geometric approach to these
identities in the case of Siegel modular varieties
using the combinatorial properties of the
Coxeter complex of the symmetric group.

We show that the Simion type <em>B</em> associahedron is combinatorially

called the Legendre polytope. 
Furthermore, we show that every pulling triangulation of the
Legendre polytope yields a flag complex.
Our triangulation refines a decomposition

rotating centrally symmetric triangulations of a regular 2n+2-gon.

We show the classical q-Stirling numbers of the second kind can be
expressed more compactly as a pair of statistics on a subset of
restricted growth words. The resulting expressions are polynomials in
q and 1 + q. We extend this enumerative result via a decomposition of
a new poset &Pi;(n, k) which we call the Stirling poset of the second
kind. Its rank generating function is the q-Stirling number 
S<sub>q</sub>[n,k]. The Stirling poset of the second kind supports an algebraic
complex and a basis for integer homology is determined. 
A parallel enumerative,
poset theoretic and homological study for the q-Stirling numbers of
the first kind is done.
Letting t = 1 + q we give a bijective
argument 
showing the (q, t)-Stirling
numbers of the first and second kind are orthogonal.

show how this map commutes with the pyramid and bipyramid operators.
When applied to the ab-index of a simplicial poset, 
we obtain the q-analogue of
n! times the h-polynomial of the polytope.  Applying the map to the Boolean algebra gives the distribution of the major index on the symmetric group, a seminal result due to MacMahon.
When applied to the cross-polytope we obtain the distribution of one of the major indexes on signed permutations due to Reiner.

The notion of a poset being Eulerian and the existence of the cd-index

We introduce the notion of level posets, that is,

graph.
We determine the longest interval one needs to check to
verify the Eulerian property when the adjacency matrix is
indecomposable and show the poset has even order.
A condition for verifying shellability is introduced
and is automated using the algebra of walks.
Applying the Skolem--Mahler--Lech theorem,
the 
<b>ab</b>-series of a level poset
is shown to be a rational generating function in
the non-commutative variables 
<b>a</b> and
<b>b</b>.
In the case the poset is also Eulerian,
the analogous result holds for the

As an instance we deduce that the proportion of odd

A simplicial complex arising from the
WDVV (Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde)
equations of string theory  is 
shown to correspond to the Whitehouse
complex.
Using discrete Morse theory,
elementary proofs of its
topological structure
(homotopy
equivalent to a wedge of
spheres, the Cohen-Macaulay property)
are given.
Face enumeration of the complex and
the Hilbert series of the pre-WDVV ring
are also determined.

<br>
The homology groups of the 
chain complex of two important Newtonian coalgebras
arising in the study of flag vectors of polytopes
are computed.
The homology of 
R<<STRONG>a,b</STRONG>>
corresponds to the homology of the boundary of the n-crosspolytope.
For 
R<<STRONG>c,d</STRONG>>
the homology depends upon 
the characteristic of the ring.
In the characteristic 2 case the homology
is computed via cubical complexes arising from
distributive lattices.
The integer homology
of 
R<<STRONG>c,d</STRONG>>
is also characterized.

<br>
Doubilet, Rota
and Stanley's concept of a binomial poset is generalized
to a larger class of posets, called Sheffer posets.
The theory of R-labelings is extended to linear edge-labelings
to prove an analogue of 
Bj&#246;rner
and Stanley's theorem
on R-labelings.
(These ideas were later used
Bergeron and Sottile in their construction of a quasi-symetric
generating function for chains having labels with fixed
descents.)
The paper ends with the construction of a linear analogue
of the 4-cubical lattice, similar to the isotropic subspace
lattice.

Extremal problems for the M&#246;bius function 
of three families of subsets 
(lower order ideals, intervals of ranks and
arbitrary rank selections) from the face lattice of
an n-dimensional crosspolytope are studied.
The case of arbitrary rank selections follows
from an observation of Stanley on the
nonnegativity of the
